# INAOS Common C Library

The INAOS Common C Library is a collection of header files and library routines 
used to implement common operations, such as input/output, character string 
handling,  memory, error and event handling. This library is designed and 
optimized for singled threaded applications and is used as common base for 
all INAOS programs/libraries written in C.

High level objectives:

* Be minimal but complete (keep it simple)
* Low complexity
* Low Resource consumption/High performance
* Ease of maintenance, testing and debugging
* Fully documented

To learn more about INAOS Common C Library, please see the Manual.
